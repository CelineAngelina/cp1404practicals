## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimates were not very accurate, as I often took almost double the estimated time to complete tasks.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

I have learned to allow myself more time for finishing questions, especially the tougher ones, because from previous experiences I realized I needed more time than initially estimated.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned that improving my understanding of the relationship between different properties of coding will help me work faster and make more realistic time estimates.


## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I learned to write cleaner code and pay attention to best practices by incorporating feedback from others

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I discovered new and better ways to write code, which helped me improve my own coding style.
