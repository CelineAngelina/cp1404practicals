# CP1404 - practicals
## by Celine Angelina

3 mains lesson that i've learned about "clean code" are:
  1. Use functions to avoid repeating similar code—this makes programs easier to read, maintain, and update.
  2. Define constants for values that do not change, improving clarity and reducing errors.
  3. Focus on logical structure—ensure the code flows correctly and produces the expected results.

These resources helped me throughout my journey in CP1404 and CP1404!
